# CardGame
CardGame (working title) is a console-based card game with limited ASCII graphics. The game mechanics are loosely based on old Yu-Gi-Oh! video games (such as Dark Duel Stories for GBC), however also uses a new mana pool concept that combines a traditional life system with an MtG-like mana cost system.

This game is a side project, so don't expect rapid development. If you'd like to try it for yourself, feel free to clone and compile. The game is built in C# in the .NET framework. This project also has limited dependency on [Vergil](https://github.com/iamvishnu-media/Vergil), my custom .NET API, so you'll need a copy of the .dll of that.

Issues, suggestions, and pull requests are all welcome.
